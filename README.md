# ExplorationActivity2

1. Which package/library does the sample program demonstrate?
the racket/gui language, which implements the racket gui library and another one too
2. How does someone run your program? 
First, down the Racket IDE [here](https://racket-lang.org/download/). Make sure that you download the correct installer for your operating system, and follow the instructions to install it. Once the Racket IDE is installed, you need to download the code. to do this, click on the green button and press download as zip. When that has downloaded, unzip the files and double click on "RPS.rkt" to open it with the racket IDE. Dr Racket will open with the code in it, press the green play button in the top right and the rock paper scissors window will open. see below for instructions on how to use the program 
3. What purpose does your program serve?
My program demonstrates the different functionalities and widgets included in the racket/gui language as a simple rock paper scissors game.
4. What would be some sample input/output?
when you first start the program, it will look like this:

clicking on the drop down menu will give you three options, rock, paper or scissors. select whichever you want to use, and press the button labeled shoot. then, the program will randomly select one of the options, and determine who won. once either player is at 5 points, the shoot button will be removed like this:

after two seconds, this screen will appear:

The score displayed is how many games have been won by either you or the computer. If you press the play again button, you will be returned to the original screen that was shown when the program was first opened. To close the program at any time, press the red button at the top of the screen, it will be the same you use to close any other window in your operating system
